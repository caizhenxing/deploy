# memcached default config file
# 2003 - Jay Bonci <jaybonci@debian.org>
# This configuration file is read by the start-memcached script provided as
# part of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution. 

# Run memcached as a daemon. This command is implied, and is not needed for the
# daemon to run. See the README.Debian that comes with this package for more
# information.
-d

# Log memcached's output to /var/log/memcached
logfile /var/log/memcached.log

# Be verbose
-v

# Start with a cap of 64 megs of memory. It's reasonable, and the daemon default
# Note that the daemon will grow to this size, but does not start out holding this much
# memory

-m <% if @memcached_params['mc_memory'] %><%= @memcached_params['mc_memory'] %><% else %>128<% end %>

# Default connection port is 11211
-p 11211

# Run the daemon as root. The start-memcached will default to running as root if no
# -u command is present in this config file
-u nobody

# Specify which IP address to listen on. The default is to listen on all IP addresses
# This parameter is one of the only security measures that memcached has, so make sure
# it's listening on a firewalled interface.
#-l <%= @ipaddress %>

# Limit the number of simultaneous incoming connections. The daemon default is 1024
-c 8192

# Lock down all paged memory. Consult with the README and homepage before you do this
# -k

# Return error when memory is exhausted (rather than removing items)
# -M

# Maximize core file limit
-r

#Number of threads to use to process incoming requests.  It is typically not useful to set this higher than the number of CPU cores on the memcached server.  Setting a high number (64 or more) of worker threads is not recommended.  The default is 4.
-t <%= @processorcount %>

#This option seeks to prevent client starvation by setting a limit to the number of sequential requests the server will process from an individual client connection. Once a connection has exceeded this value, the server will attempt to process I/O  on
#              other connections before handling any further request from this connection. The default value for this option is 20.
